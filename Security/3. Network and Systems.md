# 💥 Points of Attack

currently, attacker's job is getting easier
(all data types are digitalized and intergrated in internet)

## types of attacks
### Passive
- attacker just listen
### Active
- not only listen, but may add / delete / modify / __delay__


# 👩🏻‍💻 Network Considerations
security can applied at various points(layers) in network

### link-to-link layer
__content, headers__ are encrypted
e.g.)wired : ethernet, wireless : WEP, 802.11i, 802.1x

### network layer
__all data from one node(one IP) to another__ are encryted
provides authentication, confidentiality, key management
e.g.) IPsec, VPNs

### transport layer
- between TCP <-> application that use TCP
- confidentiality using symmetric encryption
- data intergrity using MAC(message authentication code)

includes protocol mechanisms to enable two TCP users to dtermine the security mechanisms and services they will use.

e.g) SSL(Secure Socket Layer), SSH(Secure Shell), HTTPS(HTTP on SSL)


# 🤔 Implement Consideration

||Software|Hardware|
|---|---|---|
|Pros|__cheap__ to reproduce and distribute|__faster__ processing / temper-resistant(harder to break), 'token' can be carried by user|
|Cons|almost __impossible to protect secret parameters__(ex)encryption keys) if an attacker has access to the device|more __expensive__|

some level of approval can only be obtained with hardware!
