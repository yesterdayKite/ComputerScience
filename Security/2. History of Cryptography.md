🤔 many cryptographic scheme(계획/제도/책략) have 'real world analogues'
e.g.) signature -> digital signitures
		locks and keys -> public/private key


# by case
수업 ppt 그냥 그대로 쭉 읽으면 댐 (사료중심의 example들 나열)

# by period

### Ancient period
__transposition of letters substitution__
- Greek Caesar shift cipher : replace latters
- Greeks letters into numbers

### Technical Period
__machine used for substitution__
- enigma

### Modern Period
__Most Mathmatical & Computational__
- __Shannon__ : "a mathmatical theory of cryptography"
- __DES__ : data encryption standard (create a hidden cipher text from a plaintext bits through __series of complicated operations__)
- __Diffie-Hellmen Key Exchange__ : __asymmetric cryptography__. very significant step.

### Hello Future
- network security is increasingly becoming important
- many new security problems aries
