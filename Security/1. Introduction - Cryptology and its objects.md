# 👊 Cryptographic Objectives
|Threats|Goal|..|
|---|---|---|
|exposure of data|__Confidentiality__|- ability to keep information __unavaliable and private to unathorized__ / cryptography is a tool to achieve confidentiality / not only content but also meta data(phonecall content <-> records) is important|
|tempering with data|__Intergrity   무결성__|__ascertain that imformation has not been subject to addition·deletion·modification·undue delay__ / e.g. SHA, MAC / intentional or accidental data changes should be detectable|
|Impersonation|__Authentication 인증__|ascertain the indentity of others / e.g. digital signiture|
|사기..?오리발?|__Non-Repudiation__|prevent an authorized party __from denying__ the existence or contes of a communication session (일이 일어났다는 사실을 부정하는거 막음) / e.g. Digital signature+notarization(from third party)|
|exposure of personal information|__Privacy__|__어디까지 오픈할건지 degree__ to which entity(user, device) is willing to share info about itself / vs Auth. non-repudiation / the __right of entity__ acting in its own behalf / e.g. encryption|
|Identification of individual |__Anonymity__|Being not identifiable within a set / diffrent with privacy (anonymity : action may be public, but actor's indentity remain privacy) / e.g. randomization, k-anonymity, I-diversity, TOR|
|Denial of service |__Availability__|__prevent__ an unauthorized entity __from making resources unavaliable__ / resource(computing, networking..) / e.g. prevent DoS attack / Cryptography isn't enough to deal with Dos Attack -> also other techniques(backup, redundancy, redirection ,,,)|
|Forbidden access|__Authorization(Access control)__|verify __proper privileges to access__ resorce (접근권한)  / authentication(e.g. ID) -> authentication / relate : Access control (IEE 802.1X, firewall...)|



# Cryptology

### 🛡Cryptography
- study of __secret writing__
- transform plaintext -> ciphertext by encryption (reverse : decryption)
### 🗡Cryptanalysis
- study of __breaking ciphers__
- determing ciphertext->plaintext
